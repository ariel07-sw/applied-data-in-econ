# 📊 Economic Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub repository for **ECON 5200: Applied Data Analytics in Economics**.  
This space showcases my academic work as a graduate economics student applying modern data analytics and machine learning tools to economic questions.

## 👋 About Me

I am a **graduate Economics student** seeking opportunities in **Data Analysis**.

My academic training emphasizes **rigorous economic reasoning**, and I am actively developing the technical skills needed to work with real-world data.  
This portfolio is designed to demonstrate my ability to **bridge traditional economic theory with modern data science**, combining interpretability, statistical inference, and predictive modeling.

## 📂 About This Portfolio

This repository hosts my **coursework, labs, and applied exercises** from ECON 5200.

### Course Philosophy: *Concept Extension*

The course follows a *concept extension* approach:
- We begin with **foundational statistical concepts** (such as linear regression and hypothesis testing)
- Then scale these ideas using **machine learning techniques** (such as Lasso and regularization)

Through this work, I am learning to:
- Combine **causal inference** with **predictive analytics**
- Understand when model interpretability matters versus when prediction accuracy is prioritized
- Apply data-driven methods to economic and policy-relevant problems

The goal is to move beyond running models and toward **economically meaningful, data-informed insights**.

# The Cost of Living Crisis: A Data-Driven Analysis
## The Problem
Why the "Average" CPI fails students.
## Methodology
Python, APIs, and Index Theory (Laspeyres index).
## Key Findings
My analysis reveals a **2.18% divergence** between student-specific costs and national inflation since 2016, indicating that students face systematically higher inflation than suggested by official CPI measures.
